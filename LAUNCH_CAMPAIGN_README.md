# Launch Campaign: Review and Launch Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the Launch Campaign: Review and Launch feature for the Boundless platform.

## Overview

The Launch Campaign feature allows users to review their campaign details and launch their campaign after completing the initialization and validation steps. The implementation includes:

1. **Review Campaign Screen** - Displays all campaign details for final review
2. **Campaign Live Success Screen** - Shows success message after launch
3. **Share Campaign Modal** - Allows sharing on social media platforms
4. **API Integration** - Mock endpoints for testing

## Components

### 1. ReviewCampaign Component

- **Location**: `components/project/ReviewCampaign.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays campaign details for final review before launch
- **Features**:
  - Campaign header with creator info and financials
  - Engagement metrics (likes, comments, backers, days left)
  - Campaign description and tags
  - Campaign photos gallery
  - Expandable milestones with details
  - Confirmation checkbox
  - Back and Launch buttons

### 2. CampaignLiveSuccess Component

- **Location**: `components/project/CampaignLiveSuccess.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Displays success screen after campaign launch
- **Features**:
  - Large checkmark icon
  - Success message
  - Campaign preview
  - Back to Dashboard and Share buttons
  - Campaign link with copy functionality

### 3. ShareCampaignModal Component

- **Location**: `components/project/ShareCampaignModal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Modal for sharing campaign on social media
- **Features**:
  - Copyable campaign link
  - Social media sharing buttons (Discord, X/Twitter, WhatsApp, Telegram)
  - Campaign preview
  - Copy to clipboard functionality

### 4. LaunchCampaignFlow Component

- **Location**: `components/project/LaunchCampaignFlow.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Manages the entire launch flow
- **Features**:
  - State management for review, launching, and success steps
  - Loading states during campaign launch
  - Error handling
  - Integration with API endpoints

## API Endpoints

### Mock Implementation

The following endpoints are currently mocked for testing:

1. **getCampaignDetails(projectId)** - Fetches campaign details for review
2. **launchCampaign(projectId)** - Launches the campaign (simulates blockchain deployment)
3. **generateCampaignLink(projectId)** - Generates shareable campaign link

### Real Implementation

When backend endpoints are available, replace the mock implementations in `lib/api/project.ts` with actual API calls.

## Integration

### ProjectSheetFlow Integration

The Launch Campaign step has been integrated into the existing `ProjectSheetFlow` component:

1. **Step 1**: Initialize (existing)
2. **Step 2**: Validate (existing, updated with onSuccess callback)
3. **Step 3**: Launch Campaign (new)

### Flow Progression

- After validation success, the flow automatically progresses to the Launch Campaign step
- Users can navigate back to previous steps
- The stepper UI updates to reflect current progress

## Testing

### Test Button

A test button has been added to the dashboard (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to test the Launch Campaign flow:

1. Navigate to `/dashboard`
2. Click "Test Launch Campaign" button
3. The flow will open in a modal sheet
4. Test the review, launch, and success screens

### Mock Data

Mock campaign data is defined in `lib/mock.ts` and includes:

- Campaign details matching the Figma designs
- Realistic milestone information
- Engagement metrics
- Creator information

## Design System Compliance

The implementation follows the existing design system:

- **Colors**: Uses predefined theme colors (`#F5F5F5`, `#B5B5B5`, `#2A2A2A`, etc.)
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing components
- **Spacing**: Follows established patterns
- **Components**: Reuses existing UI components (Button, Badge, Dialog, etc.)
- **Icons**: Uses Lucide React icons as specified

## Accessibility

The implementation includes accessibility features:

- Proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly content
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance

## Responsive Design

All components are responsive and work on:

- Desktop (default)
- Tablet (responsive breakpoints)
- Mobile (optimized layouts)

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- API error states
- Loading states
- Empty states
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallbacks

## Future Enhancements

When backend integration is complete:

1. Replace mock API calls with real endpoints
2. Add real-time status updates during campaign launch
3. Implement actual blockchain transaction handling
4. Add campaign analytics and tracking
5. Implement real social media sharing with tracking

└── page.tsx                    # Test button integration
```

## Usage

To use the Launch Campaign flow:

1. Import the components:

```tsx
import { LaunchCampaignFlow } from '@/components/project';
```

2. Use in your component:

```tsx
<LaunchCampaignFlow
  projectId='your-project-id'
  onBack={() => {
    /* handle back */
  }}
  onComplete={() => {
    /* handle completion */
  }}
/>
```

The implementation is ready for testing and can be easily integrated with real backend endpoints when available.
