- Milestone-Based Fund Releases

## 2. Technology Stack
### Backend:
- **Next.js API Routes** (for server-side logic)
- **Prisma ORM** (for database interactions)
- **PostgreSQL** (for storage)
- **Stellar SDK** (for blockchain interactions)

### Frontend:
- **Next.js (App Router)** (for the main web application)
- **Shadcn** (for UI development)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Zustand** (for state management)

### Infrastructure:
- **Vercel** (for frontend hosting & deployment)
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **GitHub Actions** (for CI/CD pipelines)

## 3. Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** & **npm**
- **Docker** (for containerized development)
- **PostgreSQL** (for database setup)
- **Rust** & **Soroban CLI** (for smart contract development)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Setup
1. **Fork the repository https://github.com/0xdevcollins/boundless and clone your fork:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/boundless.git
   cd boundless
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` and configure database, Stellar, and authentication settings.
4. **Start development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

- Follow **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.).
- Use **TypeScript**.
- Keep functions modular and reusable.

---

## 6. Smart Contract Development
Boundless uses **Soroban smart contracts** for funding and milestone tracking.
### Key Contracts:
1. `create_project(project_id, creator_address, metadata_uri, funding_target, milestone_count)`
2. `vote_project(project_id, vote_value)`
3. `fund_project(project_id, amount)`
4. `release_milestone(project_id, milestone_number)`
5. `refund(project_id)`

### Developing Smart Contracts
1. **Install Soroban CLI:**
   https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup
2. **Write a new contract in Rust:**
   - Place it under `contracts/` directory.
   - Example structure:
     ```rust
     #[soroban_sdk::contract]
     pub struct ProjectContract;
     ```
3. **test & Build:**
   ```sh
   cargo test
   cargo build
   ```

---

## 7. Testing
- **Test smart contracts:**
  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```

---

## 8. Deployment & CI/CD
Boundless uses **GitHub Actions** for deployment.
### Deployment Steps:
1. **Push to `main` branch**
2. **GitHub Actions** runs tests & builds the project
3. **Vercel** automatically deploys frontend
4. **Backend updates** are deployed manually
